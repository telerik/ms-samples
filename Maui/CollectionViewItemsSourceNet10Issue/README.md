**Description of the issue**
I have a page that contains a CollectionView. Based on some input, I update its ItemsSource. However, when the CollectionView is initially arranged with a height of zero, updating the ItemsSource and invalidating the measure still results in a measured height of zero.

This issue appears to be related to the switch from CollectionViewHandler to CollectionViewHandler2 as the default handler for iOS/Catalyst. When I revert to using the original CollectionViewHandler, the layout behaves as expected.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Run the project.
2. Type for example "G" in the entry part.

**Expected Behavior**
The CollectionView should visualize a single item "Germany".

**Actual Behavior**
The CollectionView doesn't visualize any item and measure returns zero.

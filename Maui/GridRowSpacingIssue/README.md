**Description of the issue**
When using a Grid layout with multiple columns and a defined ColumnSpacing, placing a View on a star-sized row (RowDefinition Height="*") and setting its ColumnSpan to span all columns results in unexpected layout behavior. Specifically, the View appears to have a gap on its right side equal to the gridâ€™s ColumnSpacing.

This issue occurs only when the star row is not the first row in the grid. If the grid has row definitions like RowDefinitions="Auto, *" and the View is placed on Grid.Row="1", the layout behaves incorrectly. In contrast, if the star row is the first row, the layout works as expected.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Run the attached project.
2. Observe the gap on the right side of the view that spans all columns in the grid.

**Expected Behavior**
The view should take the full width of the Grid layout.

**Actual Behavior**
There is a gap on the right side of the view which is the ColumnSpacing of the Grid layout.

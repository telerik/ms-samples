**Description of the issue**
Maui: Very bad performance in net8 compared to net7. Run this app in both net7 and net8 to see the difference.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Run the project 
2. Click the Reload Button at the Bottom

**Expected Behavior**
The colors should get reloaded in a couple of seconds (in my setup net7 loads in 5 seconds on Android, 3 seconds on iOS, 1 second on WinUI).

**Actual Behavior**
The colors get reloaded very slowly (in my setup net8 loads in 15 second on WinUI, and I gave up waiting Android and iOS after 3 minutes).

**Description of the issue**
I have a custom control with a VisualState defined in XAML. When XamlC runs during compilation, it throws the following error: XamlC error XC0000: Cannot resolve type "http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui:MyButton"

It appears that XamlC is unable to resolve the custom control type specified in the XAML namespace.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Create a custom control named MyButton that inherits from Button.
2. Declare the XML namespace (xmlns) for MyButton in your XAML file.
3. Use MyButton in XAML and define a VisualState for it.
4. Build the project.

**Expected Behavior**
The project builds successfully, and the custom control MyButton is recognized by XamlC. The VisualState defined in XAML is applied correctly to the control.

**Actual Behavior**
The build fails with the following compile-time error from XamlC: XamlC error XC0000: Cannot resolve type "http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui:MyButton"
